# Blue-effects
older Blue effects, improved (by adding Automation Lines if possible) and standardized. 

Due to some changes in Blue some years ago, some of the older effects were no longer working. They are now up-to-date and improved and sometimes extended to have the same look as other effects in BlueShare.

Have a look at https://github.com/tjingboem/Blue-effects/wiki/blue-Blue-effects for more information on the Blue effects.
